About
This project was created in my spare time to demonstrate full-stack development skills. It is a baseball player management system that can be used to store players and their info such as batting stance, and hometown.

This full-stack application is meant to run on AWS infrastructure. The front-end can easily be deployed and served from an S3 bucket, while the back-end can be run on an EC2 instance with a NGINX reverse proxy server in front of it forwarding traffic to port 8080. The database used by this application is an RDS MySQL database instance.

This application is no longer deployed due to the steep recurring costs and the fact that this is a personal project for my portfolio rather than one that is meant to provide a useful service.

Additional Info
The front-end of this application was built using the React.js framework, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The back-end of this application was built using Express and Node.js.

Technologies used to run and deploy this application include AWS EC2, AWS RDS, AWS S3, and NGINX as a reverse-proxy server.
